- Indent using four spaces.
- Keep line length under 120 characters when possible.
- Do not commit files in `.gradle/` or other build output directories.

## Programmatic checks
The Android SDK is not available in this environment, so Gradle builds cannot be executed.

No programmatic checks are required for any changes.

## Commit messages
- Summarize the change in a short headline under 50 characters.
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add new tile type").
